I need to work onthe responsiveness between mobile and Desktop. I got it to line up right, but the modal is too big on desktop and too small on mobile. I could have solved this with a media query. Its a simple design but the coding was fun. I learned a lot about design patterns and how JS works.

The responsiveness is not good enough as far as the titles you enter. If the book title is too long it gets crowded. Next time I will design the "cards" to expand for the information.
Also the cards should expand when on mobile.

I could make the font responsive as well...

It's all about learning... slowly I am.
