Learned a lot with this litle application. I learned that I could have written a lot less code by cloning a div instead of dynamically generating the entire card. However it was a good lesson because it taught me that when you do generate HTML, you have to also create the events and actions associated with it as well. I had thought that I could make a blueprint of the "card" and bind events, and then generate the HTMl to match. But I was wrong. I also learned that I am terrrible at webDesign. I ended up looking at others solutioins (not the code, I could not sleep if I did) to get an idea on how to design the interface. My colors are questionable but I am happy with the over all "mobile" type theme and I managed to get it 100% responsive.
